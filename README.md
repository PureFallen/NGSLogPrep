# NGSLogPrep
Low effort Python module to prepare PSO2NGS log messages for further use.

The source code was made available after I was heavily accused of distributing malware within PSO2:NGS.

The code has literally been thrown together and patched several times over the last few years and as such is definitely a mess. It was never intended to be state of the art or performant, or I probably would have used something other than Python code for it. It just _works_, and that was good enough for me during that time.
